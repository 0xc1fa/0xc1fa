## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

Nei hou! I'm a web developer based in Hong Kong, currently pursuing my studies at HKU. My passion lies in building web-based applications and packages, and occasionally, I delve into IoT projects.

## ðŸ‘‡ Current Project
I'm currently dedicating my time to developing a UI library called [React MIDI Editor](https://github.com/chanyatfu/react-midi-editor). It's a mobile-friendly MIDI editor library designed to support essential features right out of the box, including copy/cut/paste, redo/undo, and import/export functionalities, among others!
