## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nei hou! I'm a web developer based in Hong Kong, currently pursuing my studies at the University of Hong Kong. My passion lies in building web-based applications and packages, and occasionally, I delve into IoT projects.

## Current Project ðŸ‘‡
I'm currently dedicating my time to developing a UI library called React MIDI Editor. It's a mobile-friendly MIDI editor library designed to support essential features right out of the box, including copy/cut/paste, redo/undo, and import/export functionalities, among others!

## What I am learning right now...

As an active learner, I'm constantly seeking to broaden my programming knowledge. Books and blog posts are my go-to resources for new insights and deep dives into complex topics. Currently, I'm immersed in [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-definitive/9781491952016/) to master the intricacies of JavaScript.
